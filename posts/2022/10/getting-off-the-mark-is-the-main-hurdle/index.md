As firecrackers light up the night sky, I sti by window and try to get past this hurdle.

Wanting to write has been within me for a very long time. But, what to write about? Tech? Career? Book reviews? Movie reviews? or just about anything? I do not know.

Among the uncertainities, only certainity was that "I want to write".

So, here is how it came to being...

## Preparation

In the past, I tried writing on wordpress.org. Wrote some posts and then stopped. Then, in the past year, I wrote a couple technical blog posts and SAP Community portal. While I would still continue that, I may very well post more here from now on.

This idea of having a site of my own came to me yesterday as I was watching India v/s Pakistan match. India had lost 4 early wickets. Prospects were not at all looked in India's favor. But, there was still hope. I mean, Virat Kohli.

As soon as the idea of having of site came to me, I thought of developing a blog site of own with NextJS or something like that. But, then, I realized it's important to get started with writing than spending a month developing a site for it.

So, having a Wordpress site seemed easier given that I had developed a few wordpress sites in the past.

## Domain and Hosting

I quickly got to work - bought domain on my name on GoDaddy. "dot in" domain costed only a few hundred rupees. I researched a little bit about best hosting site for Wordpress sites. Unfortunately, SiteGround wa not avaiable in India. So, zeroed in on BlueHost.

By this time, game of Cricket had come to a nail biting sitautation. India clinched a last ball victory. I thought I was going to have a heart attack by the end. So, the "site" had to a take a back seat.

## The Site

As the domain was already bought, I had to make something with it. So, hosting was also bought this morning on BlueHost India. By afternoon, I started installing theme and customizing the site. I gave myself 1 hour. At the end of about 4 hours, finally the site was launched (2nd time, because I messed up with the site URL the first time and had to delete the whole site and redo it all from sratch).

So, finally, here we are.

## Now what...

This site is a promise to myself to keep writing daily, or at least regularly. About anything and everything I read, watch and learn and do. May be, some day, someone else find these interesting or useful or both.

As the hurdle has been crossed now, I hope the remaining journey would be easier for the writer in me. As they say, without consistency, nothing else matters. Nothing!

And that's the only thing I seem to struggle with.
