I grew up in a very small village. There were only 5 houses which and not many people as you can imagine. I stayed in the village till I completed my primary school and then moved another village which was similar to mine.

25 years ago, winters used to be harsher; Summers, not as hotter. Some times, when the other kids were not in the village which meant no one play anything with, morning used to be filled with utter silence. I would sit the portico under the warm sunlight of December or Janaury with nothing to do. Some times, a newspaper to read. There was no TV, no mobile phones and no other gadget to entertain me. Elders would not have time to play with me in the morning. When did they have time anyway?

If I close my eyes and sit, I can still remember those times, the feeling, the silence. Suddenly, someone's mixi would make a 'royyynnn' sound and stop and come back to life again. Someone far away voice would shout out for someone else and die down. A lowing of a cow, a balf of a calf, cooing of pigeons or chirping of sparrows would what I could hear in an otherwise quiet mornings. A couple of sparrows would bring dry grass and thin branches from somewhere and try to build a nest on our ceiling. There would errupt some argument between them about the place or manner in which the nest is being made. And then, all the sound would die down putting a blanket of quietness to whole atmosphere.

As a kid, I remember sitting on the portico or front yeard of our house for long hours, doing almost nothing, getting warmer under the winter sun. How long has it been since I spent such quiet, doing-nothing time? How long has it been since YOU spent such times?

After the secondary schooling, I moved to a small town and then to a bigger town and to a city for work. Lived in different cities, different places and houses. But, whenever I go to a terrace at night and look around to find tall structrures as far as my eyes can see, I get this very strange feeling that "I don't belong here". This feeling is not new, it has been with me since I moved to town and to cities. It's like being lost amidst a million human beings. I ask myself, "what am I doing here?"

I haven't got the answer yet. Don't know whether I will ever. There is something with these terraces that probably make me feel I should go back to villages. But,are those villages still the same? Do they have that silence, that quietness which they used to? Haven't COVID made sure that every one of them got the internet and with it all the distractions of the world?
