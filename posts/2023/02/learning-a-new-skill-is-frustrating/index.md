excerpt: We all learn new things on a daily basis.  As kids, we explored new physical and mental skills quicker and more often.  But, as adults, how often do we embark on a completely unknown territory to learn something new?

But it is highly rewarding!

Yes, learning something new out of your comfort zone, something that you have never done before can be very frustrating in the beginning, but as you keep getting better at it, it becomes a source of joy.

It could be a physical skill like learning to play a new sport, or learning to dance or skateboarding or surfing. Or it could be a mental skill like learning to meditate, or to focus etc.

When you get started, you usually have a very high level of motivation (because that's why you got started in the first place), but your skills suck. You fail. You fail more often. That's frustrating. You start to doubt your abilities. But if you keep at it and keep working on improving your skills, seek feedback and correct your mistakes, you will start getting better.

As you get better at it, you look for new challenges. You start enjoying the small wins and seek them more often. Those small wins become the fuel for your journey ahead in your chosen area.

To keep things interesting, you need to seek challenges that are slightly above your current skill level. Too tough a challenge, there is danger of you losing hope and confidence. Too easy a challenge, you get bored of it too soon.

This is applicable to all kinds of physical or mental skills, sports or creative hobbies.

Seek new challenges, harder problems to crack, tougher opponents to play against. That's how you hone your skills and keep things interesting.

Happy Learning!

PS: I got an opportunity to try Surfing for the first time in my life recently. It was a 3 days Beginner level course. I will write about it in another post!
