excerpt: Dosa is not just a breakfast dish. It is an emotion for many.  But there is a community that eats dosa on a daily basis, that too which is as thin as the paper itself!

Dosa dosa dosa. . ![1f60b.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f60b.png)

The day starts at 5.30am for elders and for others when they smell Dosa ![1f601.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f601.png)

Morning beauty of the villages can't be described with my posting skills. .

Day starts for Dosa if you are a kid, adult, oldie or whatever ![1f603.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f603.png)

You gotta be dexterous and quick to get it out of the pan ![1f602.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f602.png)

The authentic kitchen. . a special seat for the Dosa maker. ![1f60c.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f60c.png)

Anyone who sees this for first time longs for that seat to become the Dosa maker. . I did too. .

So this dosa is little special. . no ladle, spatula to spread the batter or take the dosa out of the pan. .

A banana leaf to spread, and a quick hand to take it out. . Yummy crispy paper dosa is ready. . with it's companions ( chutney and podi ).

I am not a food blogger, but this Dosa is an emotion and can it get more authentic huh ?

When life gives you a Dosa, take it.

Dedicated for all Dosa and non Dosa lovers ![1f642.png](/static/img/2023/04/1f642.png)
