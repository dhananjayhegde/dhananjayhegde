Dosa dosa dosa. . ![😋](images/1f60b.png)

The day starts at 5.30am for elders and for others when they smell Dosa ![😁](images/1f601.png)

Morning beauty of the villages can't be described with my posting skills. .

Day starts for Dosa if you are a kid, adult, oldie or whatever ![😃](images/1f603.png)

You gotta be dexterous and quick to get it out of the pan ![😃](images/1f603.png) which I eventually learnt after making few shapeless and Carbon Dosas. . ![😂](images/1f602.png)

The authentic kitchen. . a special seat for the Dosa maker. ![😌](images/1f60c.png)

Anyone who sees this for first time longs for that seat to become the Dosa maker. . I did too. .

So this dosa is little special. . no ladle, spatula to spread the batter or take the dosa out of the pan. .

A banana leaf to spread, and a quick hand to take it out. . Yummy crispy paper dosa is ready. . with it's companions ( chutney and podi ).

I am not a food blogger, but this Dosa is an emotion and can it get more authentic huh ?

When life gives you a Dosa, take it.

Dedicated for all Dosa and non Dosa lovers ![🙂](images/1f642.png)
