# Hey there!

I am **Dhananjay**. I write about SAP, ABAP, Fiori. Some times, also about the books I read and about my journey towards leadng a healty lifestyle.

I started running some time in November 2023 and have been [consistently training to become a distance runner](posts/2024/09/on-running-and-other-things/).

I spend my free time learning new web frameworks, technologies etc. I have been keeping a [goal to read 24 books every year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/53033728) but the most I have achieved so far is 17.

Looking for some inspiration? Here is what [inspires me](/inspiration)!
