# Hey there!

I am **Dhananjay**. I am a **Senior ABAP Fullstack Developer** at [CloudPaths](https://cloudpaths.com/). I write about SAP, ABAP, RESTfull Appliction Programming in ABAP, my experiments with Fiori, CAP etc. Some times, also about the books I read and about my journey towards leadng a healty lifestyle.

I started runnig some time in November 2023 and have been consistently training to become a distance runner since then. I ram my first half marathon on August 25 at The NMDC Hyderabad Marathon, 2024. I train about 3 to 4 days a week for this.

I spend my free time learning and experimenting with new web frameworks, technologies etc. I have been keeping a [goal to read 24 books every year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/53033728) but the most I have achieved so far is 17.

Looking for some inspiration? Here is what [inspires me](/pages/inspiration)!
